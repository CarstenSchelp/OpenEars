# Pi installation
You will find the installation in pi/python2 and pi/python3. The sound configuration files are in the pi directory, and are the same for python 2 and python 3.

# Checkpoints
Some utilities:
- which version of tensorflow is running in your environment (tensorflowversion.sh)
- if you can record sound properly according to the standard required by the platform

# Coral
Conversion of tensorflow model to tensorflow lite to be used on the coral stick (currently untested)
