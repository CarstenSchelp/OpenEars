With recordtest.py and playbacktest.py you can test if the recording of your device works. 

example:
./recordtest.py test.wav
^CTraceback (most recent call last):
  File "./recordtest.py", line 65, in <module>
	    l, data = inp.read()
			KeyboardInterrupt

(I stopped recording with CTRL-C)

./playbacktest.py test.wav



Be careful though:

-the settings in recordtest.py and playbacktest.py must be equal, otherwise you will get an awful lot of noise out of your speaker
-the resulting wav file does not have a header, so other programs (like aplay or sox) will not know what kind of rate or pcm format is used, and will play with their default settings: more noise
The current settings are: -fS16_LE -c1 -r16000, so aplay -fS16_LE -c1 -r16000 test.wav should create something usable.
